# TCP
Traditional Chinese painting classification

A unified database is established, that consists of more than a thousand images from six major TCP themes.
Several deep learning algorithms that are based on mathematical models are applied to examine the classification performance.
The modified pretrained neural network is capable to achieve 99.66% recognition accuracy. Qualitative results are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also note that this is the first work that performs multiclass classification on six categories in this domain. Furthermore, a 10-class classification result of 96% is obtained when performing on one of the painting types, namely, ghost-and-god.
